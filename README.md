## About Application
Seed and sapling variety detection is crucial in agriculture and forestry for ensuring optimal growth and species preservation. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) combined with the Grad CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) method provide an effective solution for this task. CNNs are deep learning models capable of automatically extracting relevant features from images. In seed and sapling variety detection, they analyze visual characteristics such as leaf shape, color, and texture to differentiate between different plant species. The Grad CAM method enhances the interpretability of CNNs by highlighting regions in the image that contribute most to the model's decision, making it easier to understand the model's reasoning. This technique starts with training a CNN on a labeled dataset containing images of various seed and sapling varieties. Once the model is trained, Grad CAM identifies the key regions in the input image that the model uses to make its predictions. This visual information helps experts and farmers understand the basis for the model's decisions and enhances the trustworthiness of the system. 

By combining CNNs with Grad CAM, we can build robust and interpretable systems for seed and sapling variety detection, which can be used for quality control in agriculture, reforestation efforts, and biodiversity conservation, ultimately benefiting both the environment and agricultural production.
